MOV A,30H //MOVE THE DIRECT ADDRESS 30H TO THE ACCUMALETER A 
CLR C  // C FOR CARRY GENERETSD FORM THE PREVIOUS STAGE HENCE CLEAR THE CARRY
SUBB A,#30H // SUBTRACT THE ACCUMALETER CONTENT WITH THE IMMEDIAT ADDRESS 30H AND THE RESULT IS STORED IN THE ACCUMALETER THE ACCUMALETR CONTENT IS OVER WRITEN
MOV 31H,A // MOVE THE ACCUMALETR CONTENT  TO THE 31H MEMORY LOCATION
END	  // END THE PROGRAM

TRACE:
A=30H (40)    //THE 30H MENORY LOCATION CONTENT 40H
C=0      C FOR CARRY SO SET C TO ZERO C=0
SUBTRACTION: A=A-30H  = 40-30 =10H
31H=10H
