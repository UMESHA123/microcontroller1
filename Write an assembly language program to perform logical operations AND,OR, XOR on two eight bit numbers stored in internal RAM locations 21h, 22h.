MOV A,21H  // MOVE THE DIRECT ADDRESS 21H TO THE  ACCUMALETER A
ANL A,22H  // N AND 22H( AND OPARETION ON A VARIABLE AND THE 22H MEMORY LOCATION) AND THE RESULT IS STORED IN THE ACCUMALATER A
MOV 30H,A  // MOVE THE RESULT TO THE 30H MEMORY LOACTION FROM THE ACCUMALETR A
MOV A,21H  // MOVE THE DIRECT ADDRESS 21H TO THE ACCUMALETER A
ORL A,22H // A OR 22H (OR OPARETION BETWEEN THE A AND THE 22H AND THE RESULT IN THE ACCUMALETR A )
