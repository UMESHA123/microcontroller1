//WRITE AN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAM TO CONVERT THE DECIMAL NUMBER INTO THR ASCII

MOV A,30H	// MOVE THE DIRECT ADDRESS IN THE MEMORY ADDRESS 30H INTO THE ACCUMALER	 (ENTER IN WHICH DECIMAL NUMBER TO BE CONVERTED INTO ASCII)
ADD A,#30H // ADD THE ACCUMALETER CONTENT WITH THE IMMEDIAT ADDRESS 30H	 FINALLY THE RESULT IS STORED IN THE ACCUMALETER
MOV 31H,A  // MOVE THE ACCUMALETR CONTENT TO THE 31H MEMORY LOCATION
END	 // END THE PROGRAM



trace:
a=30h(10)
addition: a=a+30h 
          a=(10h)+30h   30h---conten an  data 10h
          a=10h+30h
          a=40h
31h=40h
